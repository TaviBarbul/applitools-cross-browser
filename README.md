 ************************************************
 How to run:
 For the traditional tests you just need to run the TraditionalTestSuitesV1.xml for the first version of the app or TraditionalTestSuitesV2.xml for the second version of the app. Also make sure that in the Driver class the paths to the chromedriver, geckodriver and msedgedriver are good.
 
 For the modern tests just run the class UltraFastGridTests with the wanted url, either with https://demo.applitools.com/gridHackathonV1.html or https://demo.applitools.com/gridHackathonV2.html commented.
